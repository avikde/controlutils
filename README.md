# controlutils

This is a small collection of control utilities that can be included as a submodule.

The intent of this library is that it will have tested implementations of well-known useful algorithms to provide points of comparison for research and teaching.

It will be written in python initially (for rapid development), and will be cross-platform.

Planned components:
- a model abstraction to specify model systems
- kinematics utilities
- dynamics utilities
- vector field planners
- optimal control
- trajectory optimization (?)

# Installing

## Python

Can use wheels from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ on windows. See requirements.txt.
